            <p>Here at "The Local Planetary News" we are proud to present you with today's latest news updates that you
                all crave. On today's special update, you will never be able to guess what we are going to be talking about:

            <p>"This was about 15 years ago, I was drunk leaving the bar late at night and I looked up toward the sky just to
                get my bearings. I noticed there was a really bright light getting closer and closer. I sat there thinking one
                of the angels was trying to kidnap me and take me to heaven again or maybe it was a pickup truck. Then all of
                a sudden, I'm buck-naked and strapped down to a silver table while they were cutting off my parts and putting
                it into a machine for cream to make them look younger."</p>
